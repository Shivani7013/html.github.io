                  <i><b> What is Data Structure?</i> </b> <br>
                   Look around you! The whole world revolves around information and data. As a result, data and information are 
                   integral to daily life.<br>

                    However, that data must be stored somewhere where it can be easily accessed and processed.

                    That’s where Data Structures come into the picture! <br>

                    Data Structure is a systematic process of organizing and storing the data in the main memory of the computer so
                     that it can be managed properly and utilized efficiently. <br>One common example of data structure is a LinkedIn List. <br>

                     <i><b> What are the types of Data Structure?  </i></b><br>
                    There are two types of Data Structures.<br>

                    1. Linear Data Structures

                    If the elements in the Data Structure are arranged in a sequential manner one after the other then it<br> is called a Linear Data Structure.

                    A sequential arrangement makes it easy to access elements. <br>

                    Examples of Linear Data structures are Array, Linked List, Stack, and Queue.<br>

                    2. Non-linear Data Structures

                    Unlike Linear Data Structure, if the elements are not arranged in a sequential manner then<br> it is called a Non-Linear Data Structure.

                    Instead, they’re connected in a hierarchical manner where one element connects to multiple elements. <br>

                    Examples of Non-Linear Data Structures are Graphs, Trees.
